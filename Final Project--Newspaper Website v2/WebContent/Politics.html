						<h3>Miriam on hidden wealth claim vs Duterte: Trillanes acting as LP ally</h3>
						<p>By: Frances Mangosing</p>
					</header>
					<p>It is likely that Malacañang had a hand in Sen. Antonio Trillanes IVs allegations on Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Dutertes undeclared multiple bank accounts, with one supposedly containing P227 million in deposits in 2014, Sen. Miriam Defensor- Santiago said on Wednesday.
Apparently, Trillanes has the support of Malacañang because he has access in the Anti-Money Laundering Council records against Duterte. So it appears that the charges are documented and not only superficial; there will be no need to investigate. The sooner Mayor Duterte is candid about these accounts, the better for him, she told reporters here when asked if Malacañang was behind the allegations.</p>
