						<h3>NBA: Miami Heat fear Chris Bosh might never be cleared to play again-report</h3>
						<p>May 17, 2016 - 5:24pm</p>
					</header>
					<p>The Miami Heat had recently bowed down to the Toronto Raptors in the second round of the Eastern Conference playoff race, but according to reports, getting eliminated is the least of their worries.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The Florida-based organization dread that their superstar forward, Chris Bosh, might never be medically cleared to play again by team doctors, as per ESPN's Brian Windhorst.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The Texas-native has missed every game after the All-Star break for the second straight year, after being diagnosed with a blood clot.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Last year, the clot travelled to Bosh’s lung, which left him hospitalized and in critical condition.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The embolism he sustained in his calf this season, meanwhile, was not as fatal as the previous one, but officials still refused to clear him for basketball related activities.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The report added that 11-time All-star even attempted to return during this year’s playoffs, which caused a friction between him and the Heat management.</p>

						<h3>Even Deontay Wilder, an Untainted Boxer, Loses Out in a Doping Scandal</h3>
						<p>by WILLIAM C. RHODEN &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp May 16, 2016</p>
					</header>
					<p>The anger, the hurt and the disappointment in Deontay Wilder's voice was palpable - even from a few thousand miles away.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Wilder is the World Boxing Council heavyweight champion. At 36-0 with 35 knockouts he is America’s best hope in years to unify the crown that once stood as the biggest title in sports. He had spent the past two weeks training in Sheffield, England, a transit camp on his road to a fight in Moscow on Saturday against the top-ranked contender, Alexander Povetkin.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The $4.5 million purse was to be the largest of Wilder’s career. Beyond the money, the fight would have been Wilder's shining moment, one so important that he had agreed to take on the Russian challenger in Moscow.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The plan was simple: Go into Povetkin's hometown, knock him out and announce to the world that Wilder was the heavyweight division's new truth.</p>
					<br>
					<p>But on Friday, the plan went to pieces.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Wilder learned that Povetkin had tested positive for meldonium, a banned performance-enhancing drug, and the fight was postponed.</p>
					<br>
					<p>"I'm very upset," Wilder said Sunday from Sheffield. "They stole the fight. Not just from me and my family, but from all the fight fans who were looking forward to this fight."</p>
					<br>
					<p>We can talk in broad strokes about the doping scandal that has engulfed Russian sports, about the Olympic medals and world championships that may have been won - and lost - unfairly in recent years. Those stories are compelling but not universally so. Certainly not for fans who make their bets, cheer their teams and support their favorite athletes regardless of whispers about P.E.D. use.</p>
