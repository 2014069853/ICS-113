						<h3>John Lloyd Cruz nominated twice for best actor in 2016 Gawad Urian</h3>
						<p>by MARINEL R. CRUZ &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp May 16, 2016</p>
					<p>John Lloyd Cruz continues to surprise his audience. The actor is nominated for best actor twice, for "Honor Thy Father" and "A Second Chance," in this year’s Gawad Urian, slated for June 21.</p>
					<br>
					<p>"The acting that was called for from Cruz in the two films were very different," said Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino president Dr. Grace Jose Alfonso. "Whether being nominated in two films would give him a better chance at winning the award or not, I don’t know. I am only one vote. This selection is really based on merits."</p>
					<br>
					<p>Cruz will be up against John Arcilla for "Heneral Luna," Ricky Davao for "Dayang Asu," Jericho Rosales for "Walang Forever," Dennis Trillo for "Felix Manalo," Sid Lucero for "Apocalypse Child," Jun Jun Quintana for "Water Lemon," Luis Alandy for "Anino sa Likod ng Buwan," Francisco Guinto for "ARI: My Life With a King" and Lou Veloso for "Da Dog Show."</p>
					<br>
					<p>Alfonso said it was not unusual for the Manunuri to nominate an actor twice in the same category. In fact, Angel Aquino was nominated only recently, in 2014, for best supporting actress both for "Porno" and "Ang Huling Cha-cha ni Anita." She bagged the Urian trophy for the latter.</p>
