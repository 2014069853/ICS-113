						<h3>Man saves guy from burning car; gets flak instead of kudos for deed</h3>
						<p> May 17, 2016 - 2:56pm</p>
						<p>Acts of valor are usually endeared by the public, but unfortunately for Santiago Portillo, he received flak for his.</p>
						<br>
						<p>The California-native has received criticism from netizens online, after allegedly setting his camera up first before rescuing a man from a burning car in Los Angeles last week.</p>
						<br>
						<p>According to reports from CBS Los Angeles, the unidentified victim’s car crashed and flipped in an alleged street racing incident, as Portillo was driving along the area.</p>
						<br>
						<p>As seen in the video, Portillo clearly directed his camera towards the fiery vehicle, before rushing and dragging the man out of the wrecked car.</p>
						<br>
						<p>He also urged bystanders near the scene to call 911, as one guy came out with a fire extinguisher, while another pedestrian helped carry the driver to safety.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Immediately after, Portillo grabbed his phone and continued recording the bruised and bloodied man. Upon circulation of the video, Portillo received plenty of online backlash from enraged netizens who scrutinized him for taking the time to film himself before taking action.</p>

						<h3>Dugong on the verge of extinction</h3>
						<p>by The Star Online/Asia News Network &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp May 15, 2016 - 11:29pm </p>
					</header>
					<p>GELANG PATA, Malaysia - Known also as the sea cow, the dugong which inspires many tales like mermaid legends is on the verge of extinction.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The vast development taking place in south Johor, once a popular feeding ground for the mammal, has led to its dwindling numbers.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Back in the 1960s and 1970s, local fishermen would often catch a glimpse of the shy creatures as the area was abundant with spoon seagrass, their main diet.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Kampung Sungai Simpang Arang fishermen chief Tang King Tong, 68, recalled an incident in 2004 where a 30 kg baby dugong got caught in a fishing net.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The most recent spotting of a dugong was on May 5 when the carcass of one was found floating in the sea near the village after it had apparently sustained injuries from fishing nets.</p>
