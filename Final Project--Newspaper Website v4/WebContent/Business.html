						<h3>China Quietly Targets U.S. Tech Companies in Security Reviews</h3>
						<p>by PAUL MOZUR and JANE PERLEZ &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp May 16, 2016</p>

					<p>HONG KONG - Chinese authorities are quietly scrutinizing technology products sold in China by Apple and other big foreign companies, focusing on whether they pose potential security threats to the country and its consumers and opening up a new front in an already tense relationship with Washington over digital security.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Apple and other companies in recent months have been subjected to reviews that target encryption and the data storage of tech products, said people briefed on the reviews who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the reviews, Chinese officials require executives or employees of the foreign tech companies to answer questions about the products in person, according to these people.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The reviews are run by a committee associated with the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's Internet control bureau, they said. The bureau includes experts and engineers with ties to the country's military and security agencies.</p>
					<br>
					<p>While other countries, including the United States and Britain, conduct reviews of some tech products, they usually focus on products that will be used by the military or other parts of the government that are concerned with security, and not on products sold to the general public.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The Chinese reviews stand out because they are being applied more broadly, including to American consumer software and gadgets popular in China, the people briefed on the reviews said. And because Chinese officials have not disclosed the nature of the checks, both the United States government and American tech companies fear that the reviews could be used to extract tech knowledge as well as ensure that the United States was not using the products to spy.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Ultimately, the reviews could be used to block products without explanation or to extract trade secrets in exchange for market access. Those secrets could be leaked to Chinese competitors or expose vulnerabilities, which, in turn, Chinese hackers could exploit.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Further, tech companies are concerned that the reviews could set a precedent and that other countries will follow suit, each demanding different checks that would not only be costly but also put the companies at risk of having to hand over further secrets in exchange for market access.</p>
