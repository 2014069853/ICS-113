						<h3>KMP urges Duterte to create genuine land reform policy</h3>
						<p>by NINA P. CALLEJA &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp May 17, 2016 - 5:37pm</p>
						<p>The militant Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP) is taking the offer of presumptive President Rodrigo Duterte to appoint communists to four key Cabinet positions with a grain of salt,
						challenging the incoming administration to come up with a clear policy on land reform.</p>
						<br>
						<p>"Without a land reform policy, the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) remains a political ornament," the KMP said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Antonio Flores, secretary general of the KMP, said in a phone interview that while their group is not communist, the militant group viewed the offer as a positive development.</p>
						<br>
						<p>"Sa tingin namin maganda ang pag-aalok. Subalit walang kasiguraduhan ng genuine land reform. (The offer is good but there is no assurance of a genuine land reform)," Flores said.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Flores said in offering the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) key posts, Duterte recognizes the sincerity of the CPP for genuine social change and the offer is part of the confidence-building measures with the CPP and its negotiating arm the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP).</p>

					</header>
					<p>In the past few years alone, a number of Philippine companies have taken the leap of faith onto the UK market, signing off on acquisitions worth billions of pesos.</p>

					<br>
					<p>In November 2015, to help boost its global food portfolio, leading Philippine consumer goods group Monde Nissin Corp. acquired UK meat-substitute producer Quorn Foods, for £550 million (P38 billion).</p>
					<br>
					<p>In February earlier this year, flag-carrier Philippine Air Lines’ acquired six long-haul A350-900 Airbuses and signed a $600 million (P28 billion) order with Rolls-Royce, the renowned British car and aero-engine manufacturers, to equip each aircraft with Trent XWB engines.</p>

						<h3>Former top U.S. senator lauds PH's progress since EDSA</h3>
						<p>by U.S. Bureau &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp May 6, 2016</p>
					</header>
					<p>WASHINGTON, DC — A prominent former U.S. senator lauded President Benigno Aquino III as the as the symbol of economic empowerment and his mother, the late President Corazon Aquino as the symbol of the Filipinos’ political empowerment.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Richard Lugar, former chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations,</p>
					<br>
					<p>gave a personal perspective on the Philippines, including its 30-year transition since the EDSA Revolution of 1986, the gains under the Aquino Administration, along with what he believes lies ahead for the bilateral ties between the Philippines and the United States.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Speaking at the symposium entitled “Philippines 2016: Governance, Growth, Development and Security” in Washington, D.C. on April 28, Lugar recalled his role in leading the U.S. election observer delegation to Manila in 1986. He also disclosed the challenge of redefining U.S. policy towards former President Marcos in the lead up to the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution.</p>
					<br>
					<p>He described as “far too simplistic” the idea at the time within the U.S. government that Philippine policy was only a choice between Marcos and the Communists who might take over.</p>

						<p>by MARICAR CINCO &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp April 22, 2016 - 9:53pm</p>
					</header>
					<p>SILANG,Cavite—No political bigwigs in vote-rich Cavite were present to welcome presidential aspirant and Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte when he visited the province on Friday.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Duterte, who is leading the recent poll surveys, was here a day after reports came out saying the Remulla family, led by incumbent Cavite Gov. Juanito Victor “Jonvic” Remulla, was supposedly throwing its support for the mayor.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Remulla served as campaign manager of Vice President Jejomar Binay, the standard-bearer of the United Nationalist Alliance.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Remulla filed his candidacy for governor but backed out of the race in December and was replaced by his brother, Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The Inquirer had been trying to reach the Remullas since Thursday but Jesus Crispin, in a text message, said the family has yet to issue a statement.</p>
